# Feed the extracted tumour from CT Images in STL format. The programs finds the best angle for trocar insertion and the states (pre-set temperatures) for shape specific ablation.
The details on the algorithm can be found in the referenced article.
This is parallelised matlab code that has been teseted on intel Xeon E5 family processor having 10 physical cores supporting hyperthreading.
